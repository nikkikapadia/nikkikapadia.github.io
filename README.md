# RyeViews

This project is a reviews website made by Christian, Khushdip and Nikki. Users can create accounts, browse reviews, and post reviews about different things to do around Ryerson campus.
Ultimately it is a great tool for incoming students who are new to campus. This gives them a good idea of the variety of things you can do 
in between classes or even on a weekend visit. The categories were carefully formulated by Ryerson students from past experiences. Enjoy!

The web application uses HTML, CSS, PHP, and a MySQL database. We use sessions and cookies to keep track of environement variables and account logistics.
All of the code is inside the RyeViews folder.
